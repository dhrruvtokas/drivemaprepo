# Structure

This specific Github repository consists of a setup file and a batch file, the main setup file can be used for the installation while the second one is for the code reference. 

# Overview

Do you often forget where the your file is ? I understand thatthe windows explorer search system takes quite a time to locate a file, what what if you can get a list of all the files and then used find method to look for your desired file immediately, this is what this software does. It shows a list of the files avaialble in a drive in a tree like structure. The root folder will be your drive, then your primary folders and following that are your subfolders.

# Project installation

The software can be installed by using the setup file provided in the repository, the installation process requires any Windows OS.

# Technologies

1. Shell Scripting: The software is constructed by using a set of shell scripts which reduces the overalll computation time.
2. Trees: Information will be provided in the form of trees, where the top of the tree represents the root node (Your drive letter, for example Drive C:)
